# Capstone-project-on-Crop-Yield-Prediction
Objective: Prediction of Agricultural yield using data on soil quality, rainfall and farming practices. 
 
Key Achievements:  
 Conducted EDA to identify key factors affecting yield. 
 Achieved 92% accuracy using XGBoost after hyperparameter tuning. 
 Implemented SHAP and PDP plots for feature importance. 
Tools and Technologies Used: Python (Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit - learn). 
Results: Provided actionable insights to optimize agricultural productivity.
